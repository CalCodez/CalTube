        Ryan Destiny has established herself as a multi-hyphenate performer
        thanks to her start turns on television and her own records. In fact,
        she very recently reminded us of this when she released her latest
        single "How Many." However, she truly smolders when she's on the screen.
        The star capitalizes on this in the video for the cut. <br /><br />

        Just like with her song "Do You," the clip for "How Many" is giving us
        major Aaliyah vibes. It begins with her walking into an empty warehouse
        in an ice-blue leather bralette with matching pants and shawl. She then
        steps into a mirrored box that lights up for a performance we won't soon
        forget. <br /><br />

        The song's bass thuds and her black tresses (with ice blue highlights,
        of course) flow in the wind as she dances solo to the song's rhythm.
        From there on, she serves up sass and attitude as she lets a no-good man
        know that his luck has run out and she won't be the next one on his list
        to be played. Though her choreography isn't necessarily complex (save a
        backbend moment that might give Ciara a run for her money), she sells it
        with a quiet ferocity and sexiness that we haven't seen in quite some
        time. <br /><br />

        We're loving the late '90s/early 2000s feel that Ryan Destiny is
        channeling here and would love to see and hear what she could do with a
        full-length project. Watch her do her thing in "How Many" when you press
        play below.
