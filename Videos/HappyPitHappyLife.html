        With the amount of fear mongering that exists currently regarding pit
        bull-type dogs, I feel it's important to publish the truth about these
        dogs. Although most dogs labeled as pit bulls are actually a mix of
        different breeds with similar physical characteristics, anything that
        has the appearance of an American Pitbull Terrier is incorrectly labeled
        as a pit bull, even when there is no relation to the APT at all. For the
        purpose of this article, therefore, I will call dogs with similar
        physical characteristics pit bull types, unless I am referencing the
        American Pitbull Terrier specifically. <br />

        Since I came to the US fifteen years ago, I have worked with American
        Pitbull Terriers and pit bull types and have treated everything from
        minor to major behavioral issues in these dogs, including aggression.
        For the past 3 years I have also been working with my colleague and
        friend Jim Crosby, canine aggression expert and forensic dog bite
        investigator, on investigations where people â€“ including children â€“ have
        been mauled or killed by dogs. Jim Crosby has had his hands on more
        dangerous dogs and dogs that have killed people than anyone else in the
        world. There is no one more qualified when it comes to understanding why
        dogs aggress and why tragic incidents such as human deaths from dogs
        happen. Yes, some people have been killed by pit bull types and some
        have been killed by other breeds, but the correlation between the
        majority of these deaths, regardless of breed or breed type, is owner
        ignorance, recklessness and irresponsibility. Most of the human deaths
        from dogs he has investigated over many years could have been prevented
        if human failure had not been such a significant contributing factor.<br />
